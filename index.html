              Spread Joy.
              <br />
              <br />
              Spreading joy is a fundamental need. It can be as easy as sharing
              a smile with a stranger - a smile is contagious. You never know
              when a stranger really needs one - and theyâ€™re free to give. So
              why not make your smile look as good as possible?

                We do not have a company office. Outside of our production
                facility, our corporate team are all work-from-home remote
                specialists residing in 4 different countries (and timezones!).
                This reduces our overall carbon footprint and provides a better
                working environment for our team and their families.

                We are embracing different ways of doing business and different
                ways of collaborating to break free from the traditional
                business models. We believe commerce can be ethical and still
                profitable.

                the earth upon which we reside - not to buy more bullshit none
                of us really need. In our own little way, The Smile High Club
